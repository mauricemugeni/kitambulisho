        <h2 class="major">KITAMBULISHO YETU!</h2>
        <span>"<b>Kitambulisho</b> Yetu!" is simply "<b>Kenya</b> Yetu!"</span><br/><br/>
        <span><b>Kitambulisho Yetu!</b> is a means to help people get their lost & found documents like ID cards, Driverâ€™s Licenses and the likes.
An example is the IDs left in hotels, bus stations, police stations, hospitals, clubs, offices, building entrances, etc.</span><br/><br/>

        <span>The hassle of getting a new document is what we want to get rid of. 
            We want smooth sailing all the way. 
            Thats where our culture of <b>UMOJA</b> comes in to ensure responsibility 
            to helping your brother/sister gets back their identification.
            We have also ensured this does not open a window for thugs.</span> <br/><br/>
        <span>That's why we instruct that the documents be left at *verified 
            locations such as police stations, hospitals and bus booking offices for instance. 
            Don't worry, just drop it off at the nearest after recording it on <b>KITAMBULISHO.COM</b>.
            You never know, you may just be one of our few <b>PATRIOTS</b> to get the <i>PATRIOTIC GIFT</i> every quarterly.</span><br/><br/>
            <span>The document however has to be reported on <b>kitambulisho.com</b>
We cannot be able to state the status of the lost non-reported documents.
We however recommend you <a href="?signing">sign up</a> on the <b>kitambulisho.com</b> 
and record your important documents to ensure you get a notification when it is found in case of a loss.
We are working to ensure we are well capable of doing more for you.</span><br/><br/>
